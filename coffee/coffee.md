# Coffee

## Storage
I purchase coffee in bulk and store it unopened in the freezer. I found that saves the beans and doesn't
alter their taste at all.

## Brands

### 3-19 Coffee
Cool branding but their coffee comes in unsealed bags that don't work for me.

* Blend | Frida - It's an OK coffee, not one of my favorites.
