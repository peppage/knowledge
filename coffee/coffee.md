## Storage
I purchase coffee in bulk and store it unopened in the freezer. I found that saves the beans and doesn't
alter their taste at all.

## Brewing

### Iced coffee for 2

The goal is to cool the coffee as soon as it's brewed. Also to brew a stronger coffee becaus we're using less water through the grounds.

1. Measure 32g of coffee and grind
1. Measure 176g of ice.
1. Heat up the Kalita Wave series 185 Lotto with hot water but do not drain into the catch container. No reason to heat that up. 
1. Put everything together like you're brewing hot coffee and zero out the scale. (Kalita, catch, filter, and coffee)
1. Place ice into catch container
1. Now pour 205F water onto the grounds like normal. Keep the temperature hotter than normal (around 205).
1. Pour slow and very little water on. We want to brew with much less water for the same amount of time
1. Pour until the scale reaches the normal amount (500g) of water hopefully over 5minutes.

## Currently in rotation

### [Halfwit Coffee Roasters](https://www.halfwitcoffee.com/)
I haven't had bad coffee from here. It was an accident I learned about this roaster at all. We
stopped at [The Wormhole Coffee](http://www.thewormhole.us/) in Chicago and had a great cup.

* Moonbat Blend - So far my favorite

### [Onyx Coffee Lab](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/)
Considered one of the best coffee roasters in the US, I've seen them on the top lists all
the time. Would order again!

* Framily - Wonderful! Had a good mouthfeel. (only sold around Dec)
* Monarch & Eclipse are good, I like their coffees on the more traditional side.

### [Counter Culture](https://counterculturecoffee.com/)
Classic. Favorite coffee is [fourty-six](https://counterculturecoffee.com/shop/coffee/collection-forty-six)

### [Methodical](https://methodicalcoffee.com/)
Excellent! I really enjoy their site since it lets you choose classic, contemporary, or avant-garde type
coffees. Makes it easy to find.

* Blue Boy & Belly Warmer are great.

## Not at the moment
### [Equator Coffees & Teas](https://www.equatorcoffees.com/)

Was one of my favs but they removed my favorite blend. Still, their coffee is
perfectly roasted and I'm sure I'll buy again. Just can't find the flavors I want.

### [Happy Mug](https://happymugcoffee.com/)

Simple coffee selection with great prices. They make it SO easy to pick which coffee you want with a roast meter and tasting notes right up front. I've been happy with all the coffee I've purchased. My favorite is the Rainy Day Blend.

### [Proud Mary](https://proudmarycoffee.com/)

Nothing wrong with it.

## Nah

### [3-19 Coffee](https://319coffee.com/)
Cool branding but their coffee comes in unsealed bags that don't work for me.

* Blend | Frida - It's an OK coffee, not one of my favorites.

### [PROOF](https://shop.proof.coffee/)
I ordered on Nov 15th and they sent me beans that were roasted on Oct 2. They were trash.
