## Storage
I purchase coffee in bulk and store it unopened in the freezer. I found that saves the beans and doesn't
alter their taste at all.

## Brewing

### Iced coffee for 2

The goal is to cool the coffee as soon as it's brewed. Also to brew a stronger coffee becaus we're using less water through the grounds.

1. Measure 34g of coffee and grind
1. Measure 176g of ice.
1. Heat up the Kalita Wave series 185 Lotto with hot water but do not drain into the catch container. No reason to heat that up. 
1. Put everything together like you're brewing hot coffee and zero out the scale. (Kalita, catch, filter, and coffee)
1. Place ice into catch container
1. Now pour 205F water onto the grounds like normal. Keep the temperature hotter than normal (around 205).
1. Pour slow and very little water on. We want to brew with much less water for the same amount of time
1. Pour until the scale reaches the normal amount (500g) of water hopefully over 5minutes.

## Brands

### [3-19 Coffee](https://319coffee.com/)
Cool branding but their coffee comes in unsealed bags that don't work for me.

* Blend | Frida - It's an OK coffee, not one of my favorites.

### [Equator Coffees & Teas](https://www.equatorcoffees.com/)
One of my favorites! Most of the coffee I've had here is good.

* Tayler Wiles Blend - No idea who this is but it's good. (it's no longer offered)

### [Halfwit Coffee Roasters](https://www.halfwitcoffee.com/)
I haven't had bad coffee from here. It was an accident I learned about this roaster at all. We
stopped at [The Wormhole Coffee](http://www.thewormhole.us/) in Chicago and had a great cup.

* Moonbat Blend - So far my favorite

### [Onyx Coffee Lab](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/)
Considered one of the best coffee roasters in the US, I've seen them on the top lists all
the time. Would order again!

* Framily - Wonderful! Had a good mouthfeel.

### [Happy Mug](https://happymugcoffee.com/)
Simple coffee selection with great prices. They make it SO easy to pick which coffee you want with a roast meter and tasting notes right up front. I've been happy with all the coffee I've purchased. My favorite is the Rainy Day Blend.

### [PROOF](https://shop.proof.coffee/)
I ordered on Nov 15th and they sent me beans that were roasted on Oct 2. They were trash.
