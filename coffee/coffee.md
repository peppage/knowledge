# Coffee

## Storage
I purchase coffee in bulk and store it unopened in the freezer. I found that saves the beans and doesn't
alter their taste at all.

## Brands

### [3-19 Coffee](https://319coffee.com/)
Cool branding but their coffee comes in unsealed bags that don't work for me.

* Blend | Frida - It's an OK coffee, not one of my favorites.

### [Equator Coffees & Teas](https://www.equatorcoffees.com/)
One of my favorites! Most of the coffee I've had here is good.

* Tayler Wiles Blend - No idea who this is but it's good.

### [Halfwit Coffee Roasters](https://www.halfwitcoffee.com/)
I haven't had bad coffee from here. It was an accident I learned about this roaster at all. We
stopped at [The Wormhole Coffee](http://www.thewormhole.us/) in Chicago and had a great cup.

* Moonbat Blend - So far my favorite
