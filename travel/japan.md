## Key Phrases

- sumi masan (excuse me) this is the best way to get a server's attention (we heard people yelling "excuse" and not getting acknowledged hah). [Listen on google translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=ja&text=excuse%20me)
- Arigato gosai mas (formal thank you) it's just generally polite and you'll hear it everywhere so eventually you just start saying it too. [Listen on google translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=ja&text=thank%20you)

## General Things

This is a combo of things I read before going and what I wish I knew before going

- Coins are a big part of the currency - a change purse may be useful if you have one (I spent a lot of time searching for coins in my small purse). Also cash is a must - many places will not take a credit card (including the subway ticket machines).
- No tipping - it's the best! But don't bother trying because they will just give it back.
- If you don't get a rail pass, do get the refillable train card (suica, pasmo, etc) - it's 500 yen but totally worth it because you can jump on any train or bus and not worry about buying another ticket when you change trains. They will work all over the country too.
- Some restaurants have vending machines where you pre-order and get a ticket to hand to the host or server. I never ran into one that didn't have english or a picture. Money always goes in first before you select what you want!
- If there isn't a vending machine before you go in, typically you just go up to the register to pay when you are done (either they leave the check at your table or will print your check and leave it for you at the table and add to it if you order more).
- Don't eat on the trains or while walking - this was difficult for us when we were running around but wanted a snack. You just have to find a corner to eat your food haha
- Coffee is STRONG. If you don't drink it with milk normally, you may need to. But it's all super good!
- 7/11s and Lawsons are amazing and we were always in there looking or buying various drinks and snacks.
- This site was a huge help to me if you haven't used it already http://japan-guide.com/ and this thread was useful https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9io9i3/japanese_people_of_reddit_what_are_some_things/

## Places/Food Spots we liked:
### Tokyo

- [Ginza Kazami](https://goo.gl/maps/ABDEbUd1GH22) - Amazing ramen (probably our favorite in Tokyo). It's only got about 8 seats but you wait in a line which only took us about 30min around 6pm.
- [Tonkatsu Suzuki](https://goo.gl/maps/7vTeYqkYqk72) - awesome pork tonkatsu. It's located inside Tokyo Station (Google Maps is pretty good with Tokyo Station too, tells you the floors and everything).
- [Rokurnisha](https://goo.gl/maps/eRpVFcUKbYJ2) - dipping ramen! Also located in Tokyo Station.
- [Asakusa Kagetudo](https://goo.gl/maps/fDsGnDbjPL82) -  if you go to Senso-ji temple, definitely get a melon pan from here after.
- [Rikugien Gardens](https://goo.gl/maps/x7YNy2Tm8Uw) - This was a nice little japanese garden. I think all gardens have a small fee to enter (100-300 yen) but they are well maintained and nice to walk through on a good day. This was small so we were able to check out the whole thing in a short amount of time (apparently it's best in the Spring).
- [Soba](https://goo.gl/maps/T8CcNQ1vMcx) - the name is in kanji but it's super cheap and delicious for lunch. There were only locals eating there when we went.
- PIZZA - yes we did find amazing pizza in Japan. Both of these places are worth a stop.
  - [Pizza Studio Tamaki](https://goo.gl/maps/guka32B4W3J2) they do all kinds of pies, wide selection.
  - [SAVOY](https://goo.gl/maps/9Trtaw8Na2v) they only make 2 pies - marinara (no cheese) or margarita. it's still delicious even with the lack of choices!
- [Tonkatsu Tonki](https://goo.gl/maps/KZJjnkYN5w5CVgX47) - This is a great experience, sitting downstairs at a long counter feels Japanese. You have to sit at the bar. It was yummy but I'm not sure if it wins against Tonkatsu Suzuki. If in the area check it out, if there's a wait it's short.
- [Udon Shin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gEKKPqRkDjsYCfXD8) - You only need to take one look at the photos to see how delicious the noodles look. Udon carbonara is amazing!

### Kyoto

- Sukemasa https://goo.gl/maps/pncpNibZsAC2 - Amazing gyoza spot. Highly recommend this place, we went there twice while in Kyoto. I also recommend trying their sochu with fresh lemon - it was very good if you like lemon!
- Lorimer Kyoto https://goo.gl/maps/CW62qJtx7U52 - this place was surprising! They serve traditional japanese breakfast (usually vegetable sides, fish, rice and miso soup) and the guy who runs it is actually from Brooklyn! It was delicious and worth the 3500 yen.
- Kyoto Brewing Co https://goo.gl/maps/YkEY2uABB9n - this was our favorite brewery on the trip, they are only open Saturday and Sunday but it was really nice!
- Tea Ceremony Camellia https://www.tea-kyoto.com/ - if you are interested in experiencing a japanese tea ceremony this was well done. We got our tickets in advance but I think if you stop by in the morning you can get tickets for the afternoon.
- Gekkeikan Okura Sake Museum https://goo.gl/maps/7UdwTAafWdx - this was a quick train ride after going to Fushimi Inari. They have a museum you walk through to learn about sake making (in english too) and then have a sake tasting at the end. The 400 yen tour includes a small bottle of sake to take home or drink there!
- Wajouryoumen Sugari https://goo.gl/maps/g66KXc4LqzA2 - more dipping ramen! the entrance to this place is weird (and we embarrassed ourselves) you walk in the front door and walk all the way back to the vending machine, get your ticket then walk to the backyard area and wait until you can be seated. We did it wrong twice and I don't think the people who worked there cared but I was still embarrassed haha. Still totally worth it.

### Osaka

We only spent a little over 24 hrs here and actually took an hour long train ride to visit [Minoh Brewery](https://goo.gl/maps/LTED9LuL2cx) - which we loved

- Sandwich Man https://goo.gl/maps/Lqh96HQJeXK2 - we had breakfast here. The bread and ingredients are all really fresh, definitely a nice spot and a ton of options.
- Pane Pane https://goo.gl/maps/riHLsjtkAnk - we found this place while walking to the Sandwich Man. It's just a street window selling a bunch of different kinds of melon pan.
- We weren't impressed by takoyaki (octopus balls) so I would skip it unless you have a burning desire to try it!
