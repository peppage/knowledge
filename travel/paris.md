# Paris

You do need to say `bonjour` and `bonsoir` when greeting people. Everyone was pretty nice about though.
`Merci` and `pardon` go a long way too. That's it though, English is prevelant.

## Todo

- [Devour Tours](https://devourparisfoodtours.com/tours/tour/marais-food-tour-paris/) - Really fun food tour! The tour
guide was great and we learned a lot. It's nice to hit up these smaller places and try a sample of what they offer.
- Jardin du Musée Rodin - really good museum. The audio guide is worth it but be prepared to be there longer than
you expect.
- [La Cave du 38 Riv'](https://goo.gl/maps/nWxCP3eZZJkNP5EX9) - tiny and good jazz place. You can probably get in if you go early.

## Places/Food Spots we liked:

- [Caractère de Cochon](https://g.page/caracterecochon?share) - best ham and butter sandwiches, they
do not start making sandwiches until 11am. He will ask you to come back after that. Also, he
was polite but not thrilled with us. But, power through because it's worth it. Pick the meat
that looks like your favorite, don't ask for a suggestion, and go with it. You can't go wrong!
- [Magnum](https://g.page/magnumlacave?share) - great wine bar! Very relaxed and the guy was helpful.
- [L'As du Fallafel](https://goo.gl/maps/9CUyP5Ad5vTQ8jsh6) - Wow was this good.
- [La Vache dans le Vignes](https://goo.gl/maps/vJoexykQLkiHaChA6) - really great wine and
charcuterie/cheese spot, friendly and easy menu. Go in pick a wine and let the guy pick your cheese. Chill!
- [La Cidrerie](https://goo.gl/maps/JnpNrZrNTKbMLRpT9) - lots of ciders and they do flights.
- [Yellow Tucan](https://goo.gl/maps/R43v5r1Z2iFZYfuXA) - good coffee
- [Gourmandises Paris](https://goo.gl/maps/eECJMBknfFmN8ZsbA) - probably the best croissant I had in paris
- [Le Peloton Café](https://goo.gl/maps/rGu9rzeAEk5Ju3jKA) - good coffee and waffles. this place also runs bike tours which
seemed interesting

## Don't do this

- Les Caves du Louvre - unless you have a paris pass this is not worth it
