# [My knowledge dump](https://peppage.gitbook.io/knowledge/)

This is a personal wiki where I can keep track of all the information I learn. Will contain
why I made decisions and generally all the research I do.

## Other stuff

For coding I put everyone on [github](https://github.com/peppage) which also includes my recently open
sourced foodtruck finding website [Wanderinglunch](https://wanderinglunch.com/nyc).

I also run a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/peppage) with indie game reviews.

## Contributing

I'll accept pull requests or issues for mistakes and ideas you might have. I'm happy to hear it all!
