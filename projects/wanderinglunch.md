# Wanderinglunch

This is my website for tracking food trucks around NYC. It was at their height of popularity and I was having trouble
knowing if I should leave the office and walk to Broadway to grab lunch. You kind of have to choose which direction
to go in.

Originally getting into it I found Python to be interesting and so I went with (CherryPy)[https://cherrypy.org/]. It worked
but found it to be a little difficult to get on a server.

Then I moved to Node.js because that was crazy popular. It was interesting for a bit and probably taught me more about javascript
and async than anything else.

However, by version 2.0 I had moved on to Go. Which it's where it's been since 2015. Mainly because Go is so simple and I can always
go back to my program and understand it. Also building a binary means I don't have to setup a server to build it. Moving from Windows
to Linux is simple. It's now on version 5.0.2 so I've gone through a couple iterations. Learning new ways to organize the data
in Postgres and the code. Also I [open sourced](https://github.com/peppage/wanderinglunch) it!

I wish I could work on it more as I think there are improvements to be made. The [trello board](https://trello.com/b/Cf8c0Z8e/wandering-lunch)
has some ideas but overall the site didn't take off. Expanding it to other places is difficult without living there and foodtrucks in NYC
have taken a serious downturn.
