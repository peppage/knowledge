## Writing

I write all my videos and read a script. Finding the correct app to do it has been a pain in the ass.

### Google Docs

It's OK but it's not great. It still acts weird about syncing the data and sometimes I'm on the train and I don't have
the updated script. Or it won't sync the other way unless I open the app.

### Notion

Wouldn't save the last couple characters on my words. WTF

### Simplenote

This is the ULTIMATE note taking and syncing app. The sync happens instantly and the
keyword works all the time correctly. It stays out of my way and doesn't do any weird sync while
I'm on the subway.

### Zoho Writer

Doesn't work for me because the mobile experience is TERRIBLE.

1. I lose connection in subway and it freaks out
1. Doesn't capitalize the first word in a sentence.

I can't figure out what they expect people are doing with their app. The desktop experience isn't bad though.

### Wavemaker

A novel writing app but it seems like it has notes and writing.

## Editing

### Premiere

What can I say? It seems like everyone uses this, I hate paying a fee when I'm doing such simple video editing.

### [Shotcut](https://www.shotcut.org/)

Perfect for starting out (free!) and doing simple editing. I had to switch away because it crashed and would fail exporting.

### DaVinci Resolve

Maybe a contender?

### Filmora9

The pricing is nice.
