## Writing
I write all my videos and read a script. Finding the correct app to do it has been a pain in the ass.

### Google Docs
It's OK but it's not great. It still acts weird about syncing the data and sometimes I'm on the train and I don't have
the updated script. Or it won't sync the other way unless I open the app.

### Notion
Wouldn't save the last couple characters on my words. WTF

### Simplenote
Haven't tried it yet.

### Zoho Writer
Giving this one a fair chance.
