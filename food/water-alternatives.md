# Water Alternatives

I like water, I don't mind drinking it at all. For some reason there's a huge push (probably BS) to
drink other stuff. I love trying new drinks. So even if I think it's all consumerism I still want
to see if they're any good.

## Säpp

This is birch tree water. Claims of "Nutrient rich beverage" and 3x less sugar than coconut water (which I
don't understand either).

I had this one with apple and ginger. It had strong flavors of ginger. I liked drinking it.

## Matchabar

Yeah I like green tea and matcha so this makes sense.

I had this one and it does have a strong lemonade flavor. It's good but makes me wonder what
the original is like.
