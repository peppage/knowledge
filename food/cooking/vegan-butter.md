# Vegan Butter

## First try

Went off of [this recipe](http://www.anunrefinedvegan.com/2015/07/27/the-homemade-vegan-pantry/). It worked
quite well! Tastes good but the cultured taste didn't come through. I wonder if the coconut yogurt I used
wasn't sour enough.

### Recipe
    1 1/2 cups melted refined coconut oil (not extra-virgin coconut oil)
    1/2 cup coconut yogurt
    1/4 cup grapeseed
    1/2 teaspoon sea salt
    2 teaspoons liquid lecithin
    
    Blend that all up then put it into a ice cube tray and freeze it.
