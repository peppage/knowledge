# Fermenting

## Beets (Kvass)

The recipe I followed is from [Fiery Ferments](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1612127282)
which uses only the beats chopped up. Goes against the traditional recipe of cooking the beets and using the leaves to get the
fermentation going.

After 14 days it's still not sour enough.

However after 4 weeks it was fantastic! This is the perfect base for Polish clear Christmas Eve borscht.

So experiment over. Next time I need to keep track of the room temperature.
