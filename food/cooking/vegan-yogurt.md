# Vegan Yogurt

## Coconut

Iv'e made this twice now but haven't gotten it to thicken up. Probably because I was using the Agar wrong.

#### Recipe

[Link](https://instantloss.com/instant-pot-dairy-free-coconut-milk-yogurt/)

It's very simple. Heat up the coconut milk to 180F to kill anything. Then cool it to 90F and put in the
capsules. Then Instant Pot for 8 hours. Has a good sour at the end.

    32oz Coconut milk (weird green box from Asia Mart so it's 100% coconut milk)
    4 capsules of probiotic bacteria

## Almond

Need something with less fat than coconut.

### Malk

This is store bought almond milk with a small ingredients list. The only thing weird is that it had salt.
I didn't think that would effect the culture. However, it didn't turn out and now we have thick
weird almond milk.

#### Recipe

Heated up to activate Agar and chilled to 90F then placed bacteria in. Let it go for 8 hours. I wonder
if almond milk takes longer or is Malk a bad choice?

    24oz container of Malk
    1/2 tsp Agar
    4 capsules of probiotic bacteria
    
### Future plans

I want to try other cultures and see how they taste. Also reusing some of the previous batch so I don't have
to keep buying the culture would be nice as well.
