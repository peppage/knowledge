# Hot Sauce

## Great! sauces

* Hot Ones | The Classic - Exactly what it says it is. The classic sauce you love but with real ingredients. So incredibly good.
* Humble House | Guajillo and Red Jalapeno Sauce - Even better than Ancho & Morita. Much more even on flavor so it can go on more food. Not spicy though.
* The Bronx | Green Hot Sauce
* Pain is Good

## Good sauces

* Humble House | Ancho & Morita - Good! It's something you can put on everything but it's a little sweet and not spicy.
* High River Sauces | Cheeba Gold - Has a ton of flavor, really good on eggs.
* Popp Sauce | Paddy O's Potion
* Dirty Dick's | Hot Pepper Sauce - Perhaps a little too spicy for everything

## Fine Sauces

* Hot Winter | Bulgarian Carrot - It's a little weird since I believe it was fermented. Can't put it on everything.
* Angry Goat Pepper Co | Hippy Dippy Green

## Nah

* Heartbeat Hot Sauce | Habanero - Has heat but that's all. Not enough to make it the hottest sauce for the house.
