# Knives

The right tools for the job and sharp knives are the right tool. However, it's challenging to find anyone to sharpen knives reliably.

To fix I wanted to sharpen knives at home with the least amount of starting a new hobby. It is a bit of a rabbit hole but I started with the most suggested whetstone on reddit, [Shapton 1000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TPFT0G/).

## Future knives

* [Kintaro White #2 Kurouchi Nakiri](https://mtckitchen.com/kintaro-white-2-kurouchi-nakiri-165mm-6-5/) - Decent knife without being too expensive
* [Tojiro Shirogami Hairline Nakiri ](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/toshhalina16.html) - A steal at the price.
