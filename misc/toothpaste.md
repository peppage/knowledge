# Toothpaste

I don't like mint so finding a toothpaste is a giant pain in the butt. So the search is on!

The thing about this one is that it doesn't foam like typical toothpaste. Everyone says you get used to
it and maybe some people do but I can't. It feels like nothing is happening. I don't think my teeth
are any worse off so this one is a "might buy again". Depends if I can find something else, I might
settle.

This is weird! But it feels like it's working. The problem is you get charoal on everything. NO matter how
careful you are. I made a mistake by not taking before and after photos. However, I don't care about
making my teeth white only about keeping them mint free and clean. The mess isn't worth it.
