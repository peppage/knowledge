- Steam rice
	- Use Hemp Cloth to cover the rice. They use a large square steaming thing.
	- Says you can use the bamboo steamers but how can I really use that?
	- bamboo steamer, have to do it in 2 batches?
	
- Have boiled water ready to mix so that it's sanitized

- Must dilute 2 parts raw to 2 parts water
	- It will last longer if you don't dilute and dilute as you want to drink it
